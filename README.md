# KidsFirst Tracker

KidsFirst is .NET Framework MVC 5 Web Application using n-tier architecture. Its goal is to assist KidsFirst employees to create, update, and delete adoptive families from various categories. This program will allow KidsFirst to move away from a "paper and pen" model of documentation into a more digital version. 

## Installation

You may access the MVC by follow clicking [THIS](https://kidsfirsttracker.azurewebsites.net/) link

## Usage

After creating a new account, user should have authorization to create, edit, and delete families from all three categories- Domestic Family, International Family, and Home Study Family. User also should have the ability to create, edit, delete child preferences and link the preference to the specific domestic family.
